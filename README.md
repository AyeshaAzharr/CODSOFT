Machine Learning Projects Readme
This repository contains three machine learning projects focused on Credit Card Fraud Detection, Customer Churn Prediction, and Spam SMS Detection. Each project is organized in its respective directory with its own set of code, data, and documentation. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project:

Credit Card Fraud Detection
Directory: ccfrauddetection

Description: This project is dedicated to detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model selection and training, and evaluation metrics for assessing the model's performance in identifying fraudulent transactions. The goal is to build a robust fraud detection system to protect users from financial fraud.

Customer Churn Prediction
Directory: CUSTOMERCHURN

Description: In this project, we aim to predict customer churn in a business or service environment. The project encompasses data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. Customer churn prediction helps businesses proactively retain their customers and make informed decisions to reduce attrition.

Spam SMS Detection
Directory: Spamsmsdetection

Description: The Spam SMS Detection project is focused on classifying text messages as spam or non-spam (ham). It includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model training. The objective is to create a spam filter that can automatically identify and filter out unwanted text messages, improving the user experience.
